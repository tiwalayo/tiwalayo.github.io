        <p class="paragraph">I also go by Tiwa. I&#x27;m an applied mathematician, machine learning scientist,
          and
          immunologist by training and computational geneticist by trade. I spend a lot of my time learning
          and thinking
          about gastronomy, market microstructure, fencing, and good clothes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I went to MIT, where I studied math, computer science, and molecular biology.
          I&#x27;ve
          done stints at Morgan Stanley, Dyno Therapeutics, and Stripe. I work at <a
            href="https://fortuna.bio"><strong>Fortuna Genomics</strong></a>, a biotech company that builds
          genetic forecasting to help prospective parents optimize their children&#x27;s health and potential.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">My favorite show is Frasier, and it's not close. My favorite food is baby back
          ribs,
          preferably cooked up by Crackle &amp; Oink (a BBQ restaurant in Sherman, Texas). My favorite
          painting is
          <em>Le remords</em> by Baader. My favorite book is
          <em>The Road </em>by Cormac McCarthy. My favorite song is the COLORS rendition of <em>Todo Homem
          </em>by Zeca
          Veloso. My favorite music artist is BLK ODYSSY, who has nearly perfected the fusion of funk, soul,
          and R&B.
          My favorite color is British racing green. My favorite city is Lisbon. My favorite
          restaurant is Aska.
          My favorite glasses model is (was) the Ray-Ban RB7097 in tortoise &amp; gold, and I will pay you for
          a pair if
          you can find one.
